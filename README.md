# Gmail Alternatives for the Paranoid (and the Moderately Privacy-Conscious)

This repo: a lovingly curated list of email providers that don't make you sign away your soul (or your inbox) to a monocle-wearing data overlord. We like email that respects privacy, doesn’t sell your dreams to advertisers, and won’t autocomplete your deepest regrets.

Why this exists

- Because you deserve an inbox that isn’t also a crystal ball for advertisers.
- Because not everyone wants ads about socks they bought once, three years ago, following them forever.
- Because yes, your cat memes are private content and should stay that way.

Top contenders (a.k.a. the usual suspects)

- Proton Mail — The Swiss Army knife of encrypted email. Strong on privacy, also makes you feel like you’re wearing a digital beret.
- Tutanota — Open-source, encrypted, and just the right amount of mystery.
- Fastmail — Fast, reliable, and makes email feel like it was designed by someone who drinks sensible coffee.
- Posteo — No frills, no trackers, accepts payment by ancient forms of currency (like actual money).
- Mailfence — A privacy-focused suite that whispers "I respect your data" in a very professional tone.
- Runbox — Old-school, privacy-friendly, and surprisingly nice to mail nostalgics.
- StartMail — Created by search engine rebels; puts privacy in the driver’s seat.
- Hey — Modern UX, controversial choices, and a lot of opinions about email.

How to pick one (in the spirit of "make a decision before your tea gets cold")

1. Threat model: Are you avoiding advertisers, corporations, governments, or your ex? Different options for different problems.
2. Features: Do you want encryption, custom domains, filters, or the ability to send increasingly passive-aggressive replies?
3. Budget: Free is nice, but privacy sometimes costs money — and that money usually pays for servers, not surveillance.
4. UX: Some of us prefer minimalism. Some of us want a thousand features and a dancing confetti animation when mail lands. Choose your aesthetic.

Contributing

- Found a provider we missed? Open a PR and add it. Keep it short, factual, and slightly charming.
- Found a provider that literally installs spyware? Please open an issue (with receipts).
- Want to add badges, screenshots, or charts? Go for it, but no 1990s-style GIFs, unless they’re deeply ironic.

A few rules of engagement

- Keep entries factual. This is a list, not a rumor mill.
- Cite sources where possible (privacy policies, transparency reports, witchcraft audits).
- Don’t be mean. Sarcastic is fine. Harsh and personal is not.

Legal-ish disclaimer

This repo is a friendly resource, not legal or security advice. We are not responsible if you accidentally join a mailing list for interpretive dance updates. Do your own research.

Links & Further Reading

- Add links to each provider in separate PRs — make it easy for humans to click things.

Enjoy your private(ish) inbox! If you prefer having your email live on a server that also knows your favorite snack, go ahead — we won’t judge (much).

If you want to thank the maintainer, stars are an excellent form of digital appreciation. Issues and PRs also accepted, name-your-own-contribution.
